# Add arithmetic operators (plus, minus, times, divide) to make the following
# expressions true: 3 1 3 6 = 8. You can use any parentheses you'd like.

# Break the left expression into 2 parts:
# 3 1 3 and 6
# assume the adjoining operator is times, so 8 / 6 must equal to left
# expression
# to make 3 1 3 = 4/3, we simply do (3 + 1) / 3

# So the final expression is: (3 + 1)/3 * 6 = 8
